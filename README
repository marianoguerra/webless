STATUS: this was an experiment, if you like it fork it and make pull requests

you need tubes in this directory for webless to work (http://github.com/marianoguerra/tubes)

a simple example:

* get webless from github
* get tubes from github and put the tubes dir inside the webless dir
   (webless/tubes)
* you will need the bindings for webkit in gtk to make this work
   (aptitude install python-webkit on ubuntu)
* cd webless
* python server.py
* firefox http://0.0.0.0:8000
* put www.google.com/search?q=sublime on the url field
* put the following on the code field:

var page = $("html");
page.html($(".l"));
$('.l').wrap('<li></li>');
page.wrapInner('<ul></ul>');

* click on Test (you should get a list of links below)
* click on Send (you should get a link to the script that is stored on the server)


TODO:

* add persistent link storage
* find a real usage for this :P
